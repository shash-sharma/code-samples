A patchwork of code samples related to various graduate course projects. This code should be viewed the way one would view a "model home"; it is not usable, because large dependencies and some private code have been removed.

Course projects tend to be hectic, so these samples don't necessarily scream "hire me!". Some personal projects are coming soon, which are being developed with more patience and care.
