CSC2520 - Geometry Processing - Project

The goal of this project was to use concepts from geometry processing to detect straight, long, and thin features of a given geometry, e.g. straight segments of wires in a complicated electrical interconnect network, and then segment the geometry based on these detected regions. This can be useful in electromagnetic simulation tools, by enabling the use of fast 2D approximations of electromagnetic fields for the stright sections. The code is written in C++, and uses Eigen and libigl.
