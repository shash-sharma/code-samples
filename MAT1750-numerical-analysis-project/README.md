MAT1750 - Numerical Analysis - Project

The goal of this project was to implement the fast multipole algorithm (FMA) for 3D electromagnetic problems, and then extend it into the multi-level FMA (though I never got around to the extension). The code is written in C++, and uses Cblas, Lapacke and VTK.
